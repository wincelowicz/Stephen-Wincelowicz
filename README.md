# Stephen-Wincelowicz

Howdy! 


I am currently attending TripleTen bootcamp focusing on Business Intelligence Analysis. 

Currently learning: GoogleSheets, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI

I love working with data, creating aethetically pleasing data visualisations that are informative and pleasant to work with. 

I'm looking to branch out into a Business Intelligence or Data Analyst career. 

__ Ask me about: Eurorack Modular Synthesis, Ambient/Drone Music, Repetitive Patterns and how we can utilize them for meditation and flow-states!
